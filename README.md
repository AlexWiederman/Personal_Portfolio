# Personal Portfolio

## Description

This is a website that displays the coding projects that I have done and information that can be used to contact me. The website is a working portfolio for employers to look at in order to see what I have done. The website itself is also a demonstration of my skills. The website uses HTML and CSS. I learned alot about using flex box in CSS in order to adapt the webpage correctly for viewing with smaller resolutions.
